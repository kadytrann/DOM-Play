    <h2>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2>
    <p><b>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</b></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: No, for then we should be colliers.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: I strike quickly, being moved.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: 
        therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
        take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
        to the wall.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
        are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
        Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
        to the wall.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
        have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
        maids, and cut off their heads.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: The heads of the maids?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
        take it in what sense thou wilt.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: They must take it in sense that feel it.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
        'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
        hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
        two of the house of the Montagues.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: How! turn thy back and run?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Fear me not.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: No, marry; I fear thee!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: 
        Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
        they list.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
        which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</span></p>
    <p><b>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</b>></p>
    <p><span data-actor="abraham">Abraham: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: I do bite my thumb, sir.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="abraham">Abraham: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
        ay?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: No.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
        bite my thumb, sir.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: Do you quarrel, sir?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="abraham">Abraham: Quarrel sir! no, sir.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="abraham">Abraham: No better.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Well, sir.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="gregory">Gregory: Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Yes, better, sir.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="abraham">Abraham: You lie.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="sampson">Sampson: Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.</span></p> 
    <p><b>They fight</b></p>
